#  HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE
#
#  To simulate with pseudo-random numbers automatically generated, use the options 'rndnumbersPerSeed' and 'seed'
#    rndnumbersPerSeed: <value> (it is only used if the option 'seed' is declared)
#    seed: <value>
#
#  To simulate with a given list of pseudo-random numbers, use option 'rndnumbers'
#    rndnumbers: (list of pseudo-random numbers to be used during the simulation)
#    - 0.2176
#    - 0.0103
#    - 0.1109
#
#  IMPORTANT:
#    * If the option 'seed' is used, 'rndnumbers' is ignored
#
#  The remainder details in this file is self-explained. Good-luck! :-)
